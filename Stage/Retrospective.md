# Retrospective

## First Retrospective [Feb 12]
My first retrospective. Everything went well from yesterday. I've successfully installed everything in the tech stack needed and got to work as fast as I could. 

What I'll have to make is a form that users can fill in so we can get the data out of it. 

I'm going to be using Vue.js and Vueforms for this. Since its really handy and that it was recommended to me by my supervisor.

#### Reflection on your progress so far:
* Really good. Went far and were able to finish most of the basics for the forms.

#### Reflection on your planning/priorities this sprint:
* I did a lot since I didn't really plan it well. I didn't even know that this assignment could've been my assignment for my exams. But I've made a scrumboard today on Github. So that has been settled

#### What should happen differently next sprint:
* Not anything that I could think of.


## First Retrospective [Feb 18]
I was really ahead with my examproject last week. I did a lot and my supervisor saw my big progress on the form. 

Ive did a lot of stuff. I even implemented the form into the wordpress website. 

#### Reflection on your progress so far:
* Great. Just need to fix some UX/UI responsiveness.

#### Reflection on your planning/priorities this sprint:
* My planning was great but I underestimated myself by giving myself little steps while I was actually really experienced with vue.

#### What should happen differently next sprint:
* Maybe have a plan B if I'm done with plan A.


## First Retrospective [Feb 20]
I'm fully done with the project now. The last things I implemented were completed and reported to my supervisor. Currently waiting for something new to do

I have completed a couple of features that were crucial for the frontend but also the backend logic. 

#### Reflection on your progress so far:
* I've fixed the responsiveness of the webform. I also implemented a multilanguage feature that detects the language attribute and sets the language to the same language it is on the web page thanks to vue i18n.

#### Reflection on your planning/priorities this sprint:
* Planning went well. My priorities were that I've set up a lot of stuff but ran into a lot of bugs and issues since this was a new area for me.

#### What should happen differently next sprint:
* Do more research. I did stuff myself mostly without looking at the stuff that I needed to search. I eventually hardcoded some stuff that went pretty bad at some point because of the lack of knowledge I had. But that's fixed now
