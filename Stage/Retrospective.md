# Retrospective

## First Retrospective [Feb 12]
My first retrospective. Everything went well from yesterday. I've successfully installed everything in the tech stack needed and got to work as fast as I could. 

What I'll have to make is a form that users can fill in so we can get the data out of it. 

I'm going to be using Vue.js and Vueforms for this. Since its really handy and that it was recommended to me by my supervisor.

#### Reflection on your progress so far:
* Really good. Went far and were able to finish most of the basics for the forms.

#### Reflection on your planning/priorities this sprint:
* I did a lot since I didn't really plan it well. I didn't even know that this assignment could've been my assignment for my exams. But I've made a scrumboard today on Github. So that has been settled

#### What should happen differently next sprint:
* Not anything that I could think of.


## First Retrospective [Feb 18]
I was really ahead with my examproject last week. I did a lot and my supervisor saw my big progress on the form. 

Ive did a lot of stuff. I even implemented the form into the wordpress website. 

#### Reflection on your progress so far:
* Great. Just need to fix some UX/UI responsiveness.

#### Reflection on your planning/priorities this sprint:
* My planning was great but I underestimated myself by giving myself little steps while I was actually really experienced with vue.

#### What should happen differently next sprint:
* Maybe have a plan B if I'm done with plan A.
