## Sprint Review #1

**Date**: February 12 2026  
**Reviewer**: Internship supervisor

## Current feedback
- The supervisor informed me that I should take more use of flexbox.
- I asked my supervisor about what I can do about the font and icon use. I'll have to implement the use for Google Fonts and FontAwesome (for icons).
- We've caught an error and it was about the highlighted buttons not functioning properly if the button is selected.
- I need to fix that the user won't be able to skip the important stuff by using ```required``` in the ```<div>```.

## What went well
- Did alot in a short period of time.
- CSS styling is good, but the tip was to commit as minimal styling as possible in the beginning. Focus on the functionality first.
